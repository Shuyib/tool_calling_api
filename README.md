# Exploring function calling with Python and ollama
Function-calling with Python and ollama. We are going to use the Africa's Talking API to send airtime and messages to a phone number using Natural language. We are going to use the Africa's Talking API to send airtime to a phone number using Natural language. Here are examples of prompts you can use to send airtime to a phone number:
- Send airtime to xxxxxxxxx2046 and xxxxxxxxx3524 with an amount of 10 in currency KES
- Send a message to xxxxxxxxx2046 and xxxxxxxxx3524 with a message "Hello, how are you?", using the username "username".

NB: The phone numbers are placeholders for the actual phone numbers.

## Usage
This project uses LLMs to send airtime to a phone number. The difference is that we are going to use the Africa's Talking API to send airtime to a phone number using Natural language. Here are examples of prompts you can use to send airtime to a phone number:
- Send airtime to xxxxxxxxxx046 and xxxxxxxxxx524 with an amount of 10 in currency KES
- Send a message to xxxxxxxxxx046 and xxxxxxxxxx524 with a message "Hello, how are you?", using the username "username".
